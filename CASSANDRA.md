# Cassandra 

Keyspace should not be changed during runtime. One running app should have one keyspace.

## Version 3.x
In the version 3 template, we use Mapper. 

## Version 4.x
In our template, version 4 does not use Mapper. Object mapping is handled manually.

Sample query in v.4: 
```
import CassandraHelper._
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

val future = execute(cql"SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE my_key = ?", 44)
```

## Notes

Version 4 official upgrade [doc](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/4.3/upgrade_guide/)

Version 4 offers better driver with :
- Support for conf file.
- Better support for pre-fetching (fetching more results in case of very long results).

Versions 4 Mapper is not compatible with version 3 Mapper. If you want to use Mapper then these are the issues:
- Annotations are completely different
- Mapper and Accessor are merged as DAO. 
- DAO Factory is generated by maven annotation processor. So you have to annotate the entity and DAO, run this step, then copy the result to the package.   

## Set up
Default contact point is `127.0.0.1:9042`.
